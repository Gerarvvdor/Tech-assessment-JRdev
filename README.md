## Part 1: Todo list with JS | HTML | CSS

The first part consists of creating a todo list made up of a CRUD with which you can see existing tasks, add, delete and mark tasks as completed.

These tasks are stored in the device's local storage ensuring data persistence.

## Part 2: Angular contacts manager

The second part consists of a contact manager with angular.

Due to no experience with "Angular" at the moment it only contains the views and the routing necessary for navigation.

The views were created with Angular material and CSS. 

It is hoped that full CRUD functionality can be added to the components prior to review by the recruiting team.
